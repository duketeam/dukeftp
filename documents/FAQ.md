# FAQ

## Why dukeftp? Why not ____?

The other available tools like pftp, Preee or slftp are buggy, instable, slow, outdated, Windows only or missing functionality. Duke is here to kick ass and chew bubble gum.

## I double-click on the exe, it asks for a password and then the window just closes.

Follow the installation instructions in the README. [Start duke from cmd.exe and not by double-clicking to see an error message.](http://superuser.com/questions/876933/running-exe-in-command-prompt)

## Features

* FTP client with [FTPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTPS) support
* [FXP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_eXchange_Protocol) support for direct transfer between FTP servers
* Cross-platform: Windows XP+, Mac OS X 10.6+, Linux 2.6.23+
* Multi CPU architecture: x86, x64, ARM6/7/8 (Raspberry Pi 1/2/3)
* Static compiled binary, needs no extra installation of libraries
* Socks5 proxy support for FTP, IRC and Web access
* Database client for PostgreSQL and MySQL
* Built-in Socks5 proxy server
* IRC client with blowfish encryption support
* Administration by IRC commands
* [TOML](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml) based configuration files
* Written in modern programming language [Golang](https://golang.org/)
* Unit testing with high code coverage to ensure code quality

## Limitations

* No [support](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/7758) for DHE-RSA SSL/TLS ciphers. Connecting to a server that only supports these outdated ciphers will result in an "handshake failure" error.
* FXP / automated transfer not finished yet

## Installation
* Download a "Source code" file from [releases]( https://github.com/duketeam/dukeftp/releases) and unpack it or clone the git.
* Download a duke version that matches your system architecture from [releases]( https://github.com/duketeam/dukeftp/releases).
* Unpack duke and copy the binary to the bin folder.
* Edit the config files, at least a correct IRC config for an admin channel is needed to start duke.
* Start duke binary. You will be asked for a password that is used to crypt and decrypt the config files.
